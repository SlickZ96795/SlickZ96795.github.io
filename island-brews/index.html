    <h1>About Island Brews Coffee</h1>
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Island Brews Coffee was founded in 2019 with a simple mission: bring the taste of Hawaii to every cup. We partner directly with small farms on the Big Island to source 100% Kona coffee beans. Every batch is roasted fresh at our local roastery and brewed with care by our trained baristas.</p>
    <p>What started as a small cart at the farmer’s market has grown into a beloved neighborhood gathering spot. But our commitment to quality and community hasn’t changed.</p>
